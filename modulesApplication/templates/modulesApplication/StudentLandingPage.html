  <h1>Landing Page</h1>
  <h1>Message to Designers:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>This page will be the landing page for the students.</li>
    <li>It is up to you whether you would like to have separate landing pages for the different user types or not.</li>
    <li>Be careful when renaming files if you choose to have one big landing page with different features for different users. File names are closely linked to code in views.py and urls.py.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The landing page(s) are where your NavBars will really come in handy.</li>
    <li>From here, a student should be able to view their modules, select their modules (Link to a new page), view all modules (Link to a new page) and more that may be implemented in future sprints.</li>
    <li>Don't expect your landing pages to look entirely complete. Though they should look aesthetic, there is more functionality that we are likely to need and come across later.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <p>If you want to have a page that one of the buttons on the landing page can link to, this will be the link for students to choose their modules.</p>
